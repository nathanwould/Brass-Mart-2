# Brass-Mart-2

After spending some time at my first software engineering job, I decided to revisit an old project and rebuild it with the stack I had been using at work. This new version's API is still built using Keystone 6 to leverage the Admin UI, but the UI is built using React 18, React Query (now Tanstack Query), and Bulma UI design library. The result is a much faster, more performant, and contemporary-looking ecommerce platform that delivers a much better user experience.
